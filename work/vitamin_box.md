## Simple yet non-generic packaging based on themes of multiplicity, vinery, and continuous growth

This was a project of two stages: group research and individual design.

In researching vitamin K, my group learned that the K comes from the German word *Koagulation*. Naturally we tried to turn that into a tasteful company name.
The best we could do was “Koag,” i.e. the sound of a duck sneezing mid-quack. It also had the problem of being an obscure reference that maybe only Germans
would get.

Then we brainstormed names relating to vitality, health, organicness and came up with generic combos revolving around “vita.” Another dead end. One group member wanted to express a relation to thriving, so I figured why not name our company “thrive,” an active verb that captures all that we wanted to convey in
one syllable, and in a way, also serves as a tagline? There was still an inclination to attach a nature-based prefix (biothrive, ecothrive) or the other health product trope of a plus sign (thrive+), but those were redundancies that undermined the
succinct power of “thrive.”

The company name and the thought behind it formed the conceptual basis for my design.
