### Yesterday was, today is, tomorrow will be: coptic-bound books visualizing an ambitious lifetime of 100 years (2018–2019)

Each of the nine editions were customized for each friend’s birth date and name. Lists of dates (leap days included) were generated in Python and broken into spreads through InDesign’s search and replace function. A single spread represents a year. Days passed up to the moment of printing were automatically striked through, with future dates to be crossed out by the owner of the book. The books are coverless and prone to wear, either accepting damage as evidence of journey or requiring care and attention for preservation.
