### [Typo]graphic & interactive&nbsp;designer

Originally from Bentonville, Arkansas. Completed my BFA in Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis in 2019. Currently based in Minneapolis. They/she.

Often I roam around systems of shape, color, and type, crafting in various media: websites, books, paper objects, programmed animations, vague poetics, type design.  

## I don't get to use this font very often so here goes nothing. I like making websites because I make the templates rather than being assigned them. I like seeing how people curate their space. I have always been late to various social media platforms and every few months I feel like going completely off the -Instagram- grid. I've gotten rid of basically all other social media because I have a weak brain. Here on my website I do not use Google analytics. I like numbers but not that kind. I wish everyone just had a blog. I like email. Send me one◆
