I’m Vanna Vu, and in August 2019, I completed my BFA in Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis.

Often I revolve around systems of shape, color, and type, crafting in various media: websites, books, paper objects, programmed animations, type design(!), etc.

## I don't get to use this font very often so here goes nothing. I like making websites because I make the templates rather than being assigned them. I like seeing how people curate their space. I have always been late to various social media platforms and every few months I feel like going completely off the -Instagram- grid. I've gotten rid of basically everything else because I have a weak brain. Here on my website I do not use Google analytics. I like numbers but not that kind. I wish everyone just had a blog. I like email. Send me one.
