My portfolio site.

This is a static site generated with Jekyll and hosted through GitHub. 

I made the theme. 

It&rsquo;s based off my resume. 

I had a fun time.

If you want to use it, I guess there's no stopping you (though fair warning it is minimally responsive). Make it all trendy and colorful or something.
