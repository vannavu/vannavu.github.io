today I designed an obituary for mom's mom
so dad could take a couple days off work
death certificates aren't free in Vietnam
don't bother the mourning siblings there
ask the child who hardly knew their grandmother

today I took my mom shopping
it's what we've always done
at her side side eyeing the racks
retail therapy

today I drove 10 hours to console
I was told
I better bring a boyfriend home in 2 years
"why are you crying? my mother just died. you have to listen to me"
my mom died too a while ago, because she didn't listen to me
I still call her mom
but I don't know
her name is Van
who am I
when she is my prefix
