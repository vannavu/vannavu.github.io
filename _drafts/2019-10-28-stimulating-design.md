In the fall of 2017, I had a Typography 2 editorial project that required choosing an article to pair with Beatrice Warde’s “The Crystal Goblet.” I chose the essay [“Paradox on the Graphic Artist” by Jean-François Lyotard](https://readings.design/PDF/ParadoxOnTheGraphicArtist.pdf){:target="\_blank"}. I did not really know how to talk about it back then or clearly explain why, after reading several different articles, I decided to choose that one. It was the one that spurred the most questions and thoughts, and it pulled me to re-read it several times to not just understand *it* but also *what* I was doing, making, and studying. Looking back, it was at that time that I was beginning to understand (or question, really) what graphic design is, as I had naïvely but full-heartedly transferred into the design program earlier that year.

I have been reflecting on what designs remain lodged in my brain, what I am drawn to, and what I enjoy making. How does that all relate to who I am?¹ Ones that come to mind are Klim’s Pitch, Wes Wilson’s psychedelic The Byrds poster. What place and purpose does this reaction of pure awe have? Is it the incredulous news, the disgust of Trump, the dizziness of homicide? So unbelievable and surreal and hard to fathom, a form of awe I wished did not exist. So to experience a form of awe that is instead pure delight and stimulation, feels transcendental. And to be personal, an awe that hits deeply and emotionally that visual analysis can’t capture. So often people are confused by my lack of facial expressions (blunted affect), but when something is strong enough, it all shows.

Overthought, a bodily reaction and feeling of pure but inexplicable understanding. A moment of *just is*. The free act of doing, unrestrained by what ifs and anxiety. When a design is right, one no longer asks what if ___ but simply accepts and moves on.

Must art argue and rationalize itself in the same way?

A return to the tactile, synchronous communication, wherein a touch of finger directly correlates to the object, not the sending of a message to be read in 1 second or 5 hours or 3 days.

The term graphic *artist* as opposed to graphic *designer*.
