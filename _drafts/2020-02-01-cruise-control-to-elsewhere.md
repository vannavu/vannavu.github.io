Last year’s condition was “why not,” a form of optimistic nihilism and attempt to be less timid and more open. It is a wandering attitude, not a spirit of chasing known desires, but keeping an eye out for shy unknowns waiting to be found.

At the end of 2019, I aimlessly drove, something I hadn’t done since late September. I ended up slightly north of Minneapolis in Anoka around 9pm, where the lack of light pollution allowed the sky to be a dark, dusty mauve and everything below to be vague blacks.

*What does “elsewhere” mean? Escape? Parallel realities? New from here? Displacement? Establishing place in somewhere familiar? Previously uninhabited? Moving islands? Unlearning through relearning? Going “there”? Changing thinking patterns? Constantly moving, not just pivoting?*
