title: A collection of thoughts around Ambi font collection

#### I think a lot of people will make a sculpture when they really want to write a paragraph… it takes a lot to make art as critique work.

[Ambi](http://typewest2021.letterformarchive.org/VannaVu_Ambi.html){:target="_blank"} was a cloudy attempt at contributing to Vietnamese American visual culture, which is nascent as the first major wave of Vietnamese immigrants arrived in the U.S. in the 1970’s. The project stems from examining the multi-genre typography Vietnamese American or Asian American food packaging and restaurants and extends into layered discourse on Asian American identity. The ambition is to have the project itself was a lens for me to critically think about racial identity and reclamation, hegemonic culture, and the treatment of the banal in type design. 

the act of systematizing cultural forms into a typeface, which is then most often distributed through commodification and divorced from the original context. do you see the problem here?

### Before typography came language.

I struggled throughout the project because I did not have all of the language, oral and visual, to communicate my vision. The thoughts were still developing and not quite ready to become things. I unlearned the design process a bit too thoroughly... I was/am writing and editing as I go along. Ambi is a draft.

### 1. Exigence
Reflecting on my application to Type West (submitted on Halloween 2020?):

- Language and type are the nucleus to my practice. **I think of type
as the material for language** and my primary medium and am figuring
out what that means practically. **I am drawn to type that somehow
carries poetic and artistic qualities**, but I am still at odds with
the realities of why type gets made and when it get used (most
often for commercial and branding purposes). In any case, it’s
clear that something’s there. It’s a peculiarly strong connection
point between me and other people. I’m not sure how something like
letters, and not even necessarily the words, inspires people and
conveys certain ideas. It’s not wholly explainable, which is partly
why it’s so powerful. **It’s a rare place where I feel I can truly
give more than take.**

Material of language: Ellmer Stefan in his [Letterform Archive talk](https://letterformarchive.org/events/view/exercises-in-style-with-ellmer-stefan){:target="_blank"} references a 1960s French-speaking writing group Oulipo which described itself as a workshop for *potential literature*, what to Ellmer is “type in a nutshell”. I love how *potential literature* activates type. Potential *culture* extends it further.

Poetic & artistic: meaning the type itself, its form and system, says something beyond what has already been said. It participates in culture. It encourages dialogue. It reflects critical thought. It does not only look at itself.

A rare place…: one in which by circumstance, enthusiasm, support, encouragement I have been afforded a voice, an audience, a potential commmunity. I enter young but am unsure I'll stick around. There are more effective mediums with through which I can affect meaningful change. It's such a focused discipline which makes it a bit more manageable to learn, but it lacks reach. Asking all these big questions through type makes me wonder what the fuck I’m doing here. Culture drives type more so than type drives culture. It was therapeutic at one point, but now I know too much to find that unedited joy, and to be able to focus on something so small. I saw beauty in its intersections, a potential to practice multiple interests. But it is not the only creative intersectional space.
    
- Type West would be a fitting stepping stone for me as I’m interested in further type studies but not quite ready to attend a master’s program. Making type and lettering is natural and a pillar to what I do, but **I am skeptical of primarily producing type as a job, as I don’t want to be only a type specimen but a broader library.** I can’t predicate what my thesis is; I seem to be only able to do and make in the present and accumulate something over time. Most recently I am wondering what authorship is in type design and what role the hand plays. I am not only interested in what is inside of type, but also what is outside of it. **I care less and less about kerning complaints and more and more about the lineage of type, how it develops, and what culture is embedded within it. How does material contribute to ideological development?**

Library: my favorite part of my project [Zazz](vannavu.com/zazz/){:target="_blank"} is how it is an avenue to a hoard of links and writing about typography, technology, questions about culture, economy, labor. The font is only the surface. My favorite fonts and foundries are similar.

How does material contribute to ideological development?: what allows material to be realized and recognized
    
- I’m also drawn to the communities that have come out of such an inherently industrial practice, but at the same time, it’s intimidating. I used to think I was pretty independent and self- motivated, but it’s hard to enter the room or come up without a group. I feel invited by the Type West crew though, and there’s a lot of great people to learn from there. I’ve learned that having a dialogical learning environment with multiple living perspectives is essential for me. Just taking one class, even online, showed me the importance of being around a mix of folks curious about type who have or haven’t been conventionalized or professionalized, so to speak. As much as I like my books and libraries, I also need to be in a field of fruitful, social learning. Although online learning undermines that a bit, it’s a start and really my most practical option as a current midwesterner. I hope to eventually teach in some way as well, so I am interested in learning through a variety of people, institutions, and settings. Type West seems like the best place for me to share and sustain my interest in type at the moment.

### 2. Context & influence
I saw a student project branding an east coast Vietnamese restaurant. Their visual basis for the identity was Vietnam War propaganda and South Vietnamese Armed Forces tiger stripe camouflage which was later used by US Special Forces during the war. My initial reaction was *what the actual fuck?* How does recolorizing these visuals make sense for a restaurant? I was reminded how many people know of Vietnam firstly because of the Vietnam War. Classic American history textbook syndrome. When one who doesn't know the culture tries to go find authentic visuals to use, war is one of their first touchpoints. War, war, war. I hope this project is a resource, one way to expand the library.

American culture and economy is built upon appropriating, colonizing, stealing cultures, so much so that we easily forget to ask or even realize when it occurs. If something is in the world, is it up for taking? Context? What about it? Pop culture does it all the time. The model is pervasive. Nobody cares. *If I can use it to build my vision, I will.* Designers are agents of culture. We synthesize what is around us. The Instagram likes reaffirm us. It is those outside who are able to critique most damningly.

### 3. Intention, accident
Ideas I was interested in and how they began to make their way into the fonts:
1. In-betweenness
2. Reclamation through parody
Humor as a disarming way to critique
Aesthetic attraction and taste as a way to critique

non-linearity: the typography of Asian American packaging was not by design, but emergent. overtime proximity created connotation. what conversations happen when seemingly unrelated fonts are created in proximity? Instead I was struggling to construct a narrative, a plot line, before knowing the characters.

yes the creative process in non-linear, but the *thinking* and *design* is still linear. 

poetry doesn’t communicate directly. instead it seeks to reinvent language itself, how form communicates. how does reinventing the structure of form transform language? re: univers, futura

curriculum: agency in content, but what about form? how do you design a flexible, responsive framework? when education is objective based: it does not ask: where do you come from, but instead, where are you [in our framework] and how do we get you all to graduate? what are your goals framed in the social context (i.e. beyond the self, why?) does the curriculum reflect culture, the hyphenated self, or something still rooted in assembly-line thinking? is there room for tranformation or only filling the box?

### 4. Modes of criticism: the space and frame of education
it is so hard to make a design that critiques. why is that?

### 5. It was a fucking mess
By building an unconventional type family model, I was limitless. oops.

In becoming overwhelmed by all that was unwritten and the pressure of time, I began to lose commitment and confidence. I didn’t give full care as I didn’t respect my own work. I lacked belief. 

There are different types of perfection. It can be hard to discern which details matter when the intent isn’t clarified. The inability to prioritize compounding typeface edits is paralyzing. Critiques in the moment are also not really a discussion. I didn’t set space to fully reflect on critiques. What the critic sees and suggestions on what to do do not necessarily align. Critique brings the project into questioning.

I was caught up in aesthetics when the question I was actually interested in was a matter of composition (typography), how the whole reflects the whole.

### 6. Post 
I have begun building the language.

I still feel I lack a community that fully understands, or I am still choked by my social anxiety, inflated pressure.

I fear how the type being used can betray its intention (appropriation, being stereotyped). Intentional distribution, pre-emptive application, building connotation, and participating in alternative economies is an essential part to the vision.

We do not need to wait 100 years.

It takes a lot to unlearn and innovate when we inherit systems that weren't designed for today or for us, when our identity was founded elsewhere.

A truer vision of this project would be to invite Vietnamese-[] type designers to contribute fonts to a library. A collection and a culture is not built by one person. I am still learning how to collaborrate effectively. I am unsure if I should wait and learn more until attempting to lead a project like this.
