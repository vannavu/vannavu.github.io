what’s on my mind?  
over there  
what happened?   
over there  
how do I walk   
into a room?  
where do I land?  
over there

<hr>

put your best foot forward  
to trip over it

fake it til you make it  
imposter syndrome

complex reality  
abundance of simplicity

<hr>

ageism? fear not. respect, hopefully. speed of life, aging even more quickly. future present, ancient biology. shared inevitability.

- writing is not painful, but it’s really effortful. I always liken it to holding your breath underwater. That’s what it feels like in my brain. It’s not painful, but I wouldn’t choose to do it, either. It is effortful, and I can’t sustain it for more than a few minutes before I need to kind of surface again.
