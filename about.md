## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis.

Synthesis is what I do. Systems are what I make. I tend toward dimensional, interactive, or applicable forms such as identities, packaging, environments/experiences, websites, and typefaces. Covers are my jam. 

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the art school last spring. Likely you'll catch me listening to [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"}, and if you're lucky, making [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}. One of my favorite typefaces to stare at is [Pitch](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to talk type and banter about other things, feel free to [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}){:target="_blank}.
