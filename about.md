## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. I make visual systems that tend to be dimensional, interactive, or functional.

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was going to be a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the design school last spring. I can't deny it: I have an affinity for type. It's important to wander yet pay attention<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACoAxl8RPKmMfAOUMyj9oXD1n8JKapDhz6-BiB_evNk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color:red; border:none;">.</a> And to synthesize. 

I can be contacted at vannavu@wustl.edu.
