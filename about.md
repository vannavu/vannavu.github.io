## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. I make visual systems that tend to be dimensional, interactive, or functional. Some forms that interest me are packaging, environments/experiences, websites, and typefaces. Covers are my jam. 

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was going to be a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the design school last spring. It's important to wander yet pay attention<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACoAxl8RPKmMfAOUMyj9oXD1n8JKapDhz6-BiB_evNk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color:red; border:none;">.</a> I often listen to [The](https://youtu.be/QaYszP4QZ3E){:target="_blank"} [National](https://youtu.be/i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"} and [Sufjan](https://youtu.be/z9Dzy4eB_nI){:target="_blank"} [Stevens](https://youtu.be/rKzykmp8mho){:target="_blank"}, and sometimes I make [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}.
