## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. I work to change how our world looks and to change how people look at the world. Each project aims to teach, inform, and delight. Particularly I enjoy developing visual and experiential systems for printed matter, digital environments, and physical spaces.  

Originally I from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was a math major until last spring. After coming home for breaks, I ritually spectate the [Buckyball](https://crystalbridges.org/blog/welcome-home-buckyball/){:target="_blank"} the night before heading back to St. Louis. Likely you'll catch me listening to [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"} and if you're lucky, making [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}.
