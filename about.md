## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. I make visual systems that tend to be dimensional, interactive, or functional.

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was going to be a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the design school last spring. It's important to wander yet pay attention. And to synthesize. So that is what I'm doing.

I also can't deny it: I have an affinity for type.

I can be contacted at vannavu@wustl.edu.
