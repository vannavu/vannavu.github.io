## Vanna Vu is currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. She works to change how our world looks and to change how people look at the world. Each project aims to teach, inform, and delight. Particularly she enjoys developing visual and interactive systems for printed matter, digital environments, and physical spaces.  

She is originally from Bentonville, Arkansas and was a math major until last spring. After coming home for breaks, she ritually spectates the [Buckyball](https://crystalbridges.org/blog/welcome-home-buckyball/){:target="_blank"} the night before heading back to St. Louis. Likely you'll catch her listening to [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"} and if you're lucky, making [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}.
