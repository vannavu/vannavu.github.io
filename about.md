## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. 

I work for beauty and meaning&mdash;to change how our world looks and to change how people look at the world. Each project aims to teach, inform, and delight. Particularly I enjoy creating visual and experiential systems for printed matter, digital platforms, and physical spaces.

Originally I from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was a math major until last spring. Likely you'll catch me listening to [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"}, and if you're lucky, making [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}. One of my favorite typefaces to stare at is [Pitch](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you want to talk type and other things, feel free to contact me.
