## Hi! I am currently a junior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. 

I love learning, order, and delight. Synthesis is what I do. Systems are what I make. They're always visual and often experiential. Since different problems require different solutions, I work with a variety of media in physical and digital spaces. I tend most toward dimensional, interactive, or applicable forms. I'm most interested in identities, packaging, environments/experiences, websites, and typefaces. Covers are my jam.

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was a math major until last spring. Likely you'll catch me listening to [The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8yehVUF8h0){:target="_blank"}, and if you're lucky, making [macarons](../images/macaronmadness.jpg){:target="_blank"}. One of my favorite typefaces to stare at is [Pitch](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/){:target="_blank"}. I'm mediocre at guitar and German but in 20 years maybe I won't be.

If you want to talk type and banter about other things, feel free to [email me](mailto:vannavu5539@gmail.com){:target="_blank}.
