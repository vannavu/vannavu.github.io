## I am currently a senior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis.

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was going to be a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the design school. It's important to wander yet pay attention. And to synthesize. So that is what I'm doing.

I also can't deny it: I have an affinity for type.

I can be contacted at vannavu@wustl.edu.
