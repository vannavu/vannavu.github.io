## I am currently a senior studying Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis.

I'm originally from Bentonville, Arkansas, and I was going to be a math major until I somehow moseyed my way into the design school. I can't deny it: I have an affinity for type. I also like to build from scratch in order to understand how things work and to connect language and process to object.

Currently I am interested in creating semi-automated and open-ended design systems and modulating type between information and image. I aim to apply code-based/programmatic design to the web, books, and type while maintaining that poetics are as important as practicalities.
