- When you are trying to avoid something rather than to become something, strange things happen

##### Teddy Zee ([source](https://www.theringer.com/2020/7/27/21340930/the-bad-movie-club-redux-best-of-the-best-1989-with-teddy-zee){:target="blank"})
##### + full context: Zee speaking in a podcast with David Chang about how in doing everything to avoid the same relationship he had with his father, he ended up having the same relationship with his children

Reminds me of Marshall McLuhan’s rear-view mirror syndrome mentioned in *Teaching as a Subversive Activity*: 

- we are like drivers whose gaze is fixed not on where we are going but on where we came from

Getting rear-ended by the past vs. crashing forward into the past — what’s the difference?
