All of the songs I write remain half-finished and unresolved as most of my experiences are. Lyrics isolated from the music are often read cheesy, but oh well, I’m not releasing a demo here:

Late spring 2021

It blooms  
Put it in a vase  
Change the water  
Watch it fade  

I see it coming  
Tomorrow’s wilt  
Remember the color  
Press it in a book

January 2020

Feel no warmth  
Lost inside  
Distant friends  
Timid love  
Where is home  

Cruise control  
to elsewhere  
Cold feet  
ice  
Shaking hands  
Snow burns eyes  

Clear blue skies  
Frozen wake  
Sun above  
Cracking lake  
Bless the warmth

Fade into   
the blue   
of distance  

Past  
sunk cost  
Present  
not here  
Daydream  
always  

I-  
solate  
my-  
self for  
one more  
year  

I   
don’t know  
where  
why  
how?

of distance

The closest I’ve gotten to being succinct with words / as memorable as journaling.

Ellmer Stefan / Stefan Ellmer gave a talk at the Letterform Archive today, and I felt represented. One point he made was typefaces are potential literature. I have been calling typefaces the material of language, but *potential literature* frames it more actively and implies a creativity. He also mentioned how typeface marketing can be a practice of poetry. Falls in line with what I aspire and have been thinking about. The arc of his practice also follows a philosophical origin with formal exploration to conceptual questioning to engaging with the larger layers of culture and art—it is richly varied in a natural, organic, and paced way. Am I projecting? Anyway, he is also collaborative. His practice is very whole yet focused. 

He was asked what projects are in store for the future, and his answer was he doesn’t have anything planned long-term. When he gets bored, he pivots. He considers what practically merits becoming a typeface, which is a question that I’m unsure people ask enough. The compulsion to systematize something into a typeface seems problematic at times. The medium is the message. I don’t know if people understand enough why typefaces are what they are, as opposed to lettering or calligraphy or illustrative writing (a nuance Ellmer pointed out). Working in the production side of a ranged typeface illuminates how industrial the practice is and how it reflects the demands of a capitalist society. I think my goal is to increase the percentage of time spent on making the idea and decrease the time spent on perfecting the idea to death (production work). Small-scale typefaces that are useful enough and make a greater cultural impact.

It was reassuring to see a practice revolving around language and the language of letters, rather than only about typefaces.
