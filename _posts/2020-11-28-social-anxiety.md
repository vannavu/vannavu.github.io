### Social anxiety

Actor actor where’s my script

Cortisol cortisol cortisol

Flight

but not quick-footed

Retail exposure therapy

Insipid small talk

New person, old me

Can’t get a word in, can’t get a word out

Homebody homebody hear myself now

Whole lot of nothing til I sit down and write

And then what?

—

1. Non-industrial pathways:
2. Avoiding abstractions & metaphorization & fictionalization of self — but what are we but language & material :: advertisement & product
3. Inquiry [= / ≠ / →] action
