I first saw this drawing in Venice. I am in Bentonville thinking of Minneapolis. If I had went the other way in my 50/50 of to visit or not visit: there in Minneapolis thinking of Bentonville. But I chose to drink mother’s milk, despite intolerance. Fooled by language.

It is disturbing to listen then to witness the opposite then to commit the same. What of the who to trust.

Where I come from is different from where I came from. I am homeless.

##### HOMELESS
Here &nbsp;&nbsp;I was  
There&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be  
Where&nbsp;&nbsp;am I   
##### (*repeat*)

<br>
In feeling homeless, I built a structure.
