title: Rina Sawayama
---

I haven’t been to a concert of an artist I liked since 2019. Started looking into shows around here and learned of [Rina Sawayama](https://rinasawayama.bandcamp.com/music). I don’t listen to much pop but her music is cathartic in the combination of dancability + succinct yet thematically relatable lyrics you can’t help but belt along to, similar to my old favorite *Age of Adz* by Sufjan Stevens.
