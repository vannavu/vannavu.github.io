title: Rina Sawayama
---

I haven’t been to a concert of an artist I liked since 2019. Started looking into shows around here and learned of [Rina Sawayama](https://rinasawayama.bandcamp.com/music). I don’t listen to much pop but her music is cathartic in the combination of dancability + succinct yet relatable and thematic lyrics, notably to me: healing the distant inner child, guilt of personal issues impeding deep friendships, religion’s restraint on identity, exasperation toward racism. Like my old favorite *Age of Adz* by Sufjan Stevens, it’s validating, destigmatizing, while also providing joyful release. Unabashedly. 

I discovered her at a well-timed point as her second album *Hold the Girl* was written while she was going through therapy, and I will be starting long-term therapy in a month addressing some similar things. I’ve been sitting in my thoughts, and her music has really helped.

She shows up, and I can’t wait to show up for her and dance like I never have. Gonna be a level above my experience at David Byrne’s *American Utopia* show, whereafter my face hurt from smiling so much.
