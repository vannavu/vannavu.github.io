###### The tiny iron!

Wish I did book repair work the summer after graduating. I'm realizing I like doing maintenance work perhaps more than average. Doing all the little things that help everything operate, work, and stay organized. All in balance to the bigger actions. I write a lot of fragments nowadays.
